    // ### **Exercises: Level 2**
    // 1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).
    let base = prompt("Enter base:");
    let height = prompt("Enter height :");
    let area = base * height * 0.5;
    alert("the area of the triangle is : " + area);
    // 2. Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)
    let a = prompt("Enter side a ");
    let b = prompt("Enter side b ");
    let c = prompt("Enter side c");
    a = parseInt(a);
    b = parseInt(b);
    c = parseInt(c);
    alert(" The perimeter of the triangle is " + (a + b + c));
    // 3. Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))
    let length = prompt("enter length of rectangle");
    let width = prompt("enter width of rectangle");
    length = parseInt(length);
    width = parseInt(width);
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
    alert("the perimeter of rectangle is " + perimeter);
    // 4. Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
    let radius = prompt("enter radius ");
    area = Math.pow(radius, 2) * Math.PI;
    circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    alert("the area of the circle is " + area);
    alert("the circumference of the circle is " + circumference);
    // 5. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2
    // y = mx + b , m is the slope , b is the y-intercept ,x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis
    (" we have y = 2 * x - 2");
    ("m = 2");
    ("b = -2");
    ("x_intercept = 1");
    (" y_intercept = -2");
    // 6. Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope between point (2, 2) and point(6,10)
    ("y2 - y1 = 10 - 2 = 8");
    ("x2 - x1 = 6 - 2 = 4");
    ("m = 8 / 4 = 2");
    // 7. Compare the slope of above two questions.
    // The slope of the two questions is the same
    // 8. Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.
    y = x ^ (2 + 6 * x + 9);
    (x = -3), (y = 0);
    // 9. Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?
    let H = prompt("enter hours worked");
    let rate = prompt("eneter rate per hour");
    pay = H * rate;
    alert("the payment is now " + pay);
    // 10. If the length of your name is greater than 7 say, your name is long else say your name is short.

    // 14. Write a script that prompt the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume some one lives just hundred years
    `Enter number of yours you live: 100
        You lived 3153600000 seconds.`;

    // 15. Create a human readable time format using the Date time object
    //     1. YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
    //     2. DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm
    //     3. DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm
